For the Six Degrees of Separation feature there are many things to consider:
- How many levels do we want to max out at?  Is that an n^n operation?
- How can we short circuit lookups (especially since a friend will have multiple levels of connection, we likely want
 to stop that connection from being found again)- Return object could be an array, each containing the degree of
 separation and itself containing an array of Person at that degree (structure may be decided depending on utilization of the webservice)
- What is the max degrees of separation that is actually useful?
- Are "connected" people actually public?  What security needs to be placed around what information we can retrieve?  

As for implementation, it would be easy to get caught in a recursion of database lookups based on degree.  Depending
on the number of people in the system, it might be easier to get the entire list and process it in code.  However, for
large systems I would suggest looking into optimizing database quer(ies) to minimize the amount of processing involved.
For much larger systems, it might even be useful to have  background process determining the connective properties
between users for easier lookups in a live system.
